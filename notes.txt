Develop an HTML5-based web application that plots an arbitrary set of geographic points on a map using a common mapping library such as Google Maps or OpenStreet Maps. The points should be clickable so that further HTML content can be displayed about each point, and the map should support common activities such as panning and zooming. The geographic points and accompanied popup HTML content must be stored in a backend database of your choice such as MySQL, Sqlite or MongoDB, and a PHP script must be used to read the data and produce AJAX-loadable content for the front-end Javascript application to interpret.
